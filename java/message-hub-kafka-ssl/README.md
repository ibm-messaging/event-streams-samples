# message-hub-kafka-ssl
This Java sample can connect to one of the Message Hub Kafka endpoints. It can be
used on multiple platforms - [IBM Bluemix](https://console.ng.bluemix.net/) or your own machine!

__Important Note__: This sample creates a topic on your behalf with one partition - this will incur a fee if the topic does not already exist on your account.

## Global Prerequisites
To build and run the sample, you must have the following installed:
* [git](https://git-scm.com/)
* [Gradle](https://gradle.org/)
* Java 7+
* [Message Hub Service Instance](https://console.ng.bluemix.net/catalog/services/message-hub/) provisioned in [IBM Bluemix](https://console.ng.bluemix.net/)

## Prerequisites (Local)

#### Updating the Properties Files
Firstly, you will need to update the consumer and producer properties files. These can be found
in the ```resources``` directory. The only keys you need to update in each of the consumer and
producer properties files are the following:

* ssl.truststore.location
  * Set to the location of the `cacerts` file, most commonly located in _java.home_/lib/security
* ssl.truststore.password
  * If you have not changed the password, the default is _changeit_

#### Updating SASL Configuration
Finally, the `jaas.conf` configuration file needs to be updated. Most fields are filled out for you already, however, the fields listed below need to be updated:

* username
  * Set to the username described in your Message Hub Bluemix credentials
* password
  * Set to the password described in your Message Hub Bluemix credentials

## Prerequisites (Bluemix)
* [Cloud Foundry Command Line Interface](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cli/releases) installed
* Open the `manifest.yml` file and rename the `"message-hub-service"` entry to that of your own
Message Hub Service Instance name.

## Running the Build Script
Run the following commands on your local machine, after the prerequisites for your environment have been completed:
```shell
gradle clean && gradle build
 ```

This will download the required dependencies and copy any files located in the lib-message-hub directory.
Once built, the sample can be located in the `build/libs` directory, along with the `resources` folder,
log4j configuration and any libraries required by the sample.

## Running the Sample (Local)
To run the sample, navigate to the `build/libs` directory and run the following command:
```shell
java -Djava.security.auth.login.config=resources/jaas.conf -jar <name_of_jar>.jar <kafka_endpoint> <rest_endpoint> <api_key>
```

The sample will run indefinitely until interrupted. To stop the process, use `Ctrl+C`, for example.

__Note:__ As the sample now uses SASL, the port required for the Kafka endpoint is 9094, rather than 9093.

## Running the Sample (Bluemix)
Connect to Bluemix with the Cloud Foundry Command Line Interface, then run the following command in
the same directory as the `manifest.yml` file:
```shell
cf push
```

__Note:__ The Bluemix distribution will automatically update the required files for you at runtime,
using the `VCAP_SERVICES` information provided by Bluemix.

## Sample Output
Below is a snippet of the output generated by the sample. Note that the sample will also create
a topic for you.
