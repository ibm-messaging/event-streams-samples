# IBM Event Streams for IBM Cloud Kafka Java console sample application
This Java console application demonstrates how to connect to [IBM Event Streams for IBM Cloud](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/services/EventStreams?topic=eventstreams-getting_started), send and receive messages using the [Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org) Java API, and using a third party Avro Serializer and Deserializer for the schema registry. It also shows how to create topics using the Kafka Admin API.

It can be run locally on your machine or deployed into [IBM Cloud](https://cloud.ibm.com/).

For help with additional deployment modes, please refer to our [connection guide](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/services/EventStreams?topic=eventstreams-connecting#connecting).
