# IBM Event Streams for IBM Cloud Liberty sample application

This repository holds a sample application that was built using Liberty for Java™. The application will interact with an Event Streams for IBM Cloud service to produce and consume messages.

**Liberty for Java™ applications on IBM Cloud®** are powered by the IBM WebSphere® Liberty Buildpack. The Liberty profile is a highly composable, fast-to-start, dynamic application server runtime environment. It is part of IBM WebSphere Application Server v8.5.5.
