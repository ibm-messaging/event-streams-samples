# Running in IBM Cloud Foundry

## Prerequisites
To build and run the sample, you must have the done the following:

* Obtain this repository's contents, either use `git` or just download the samples as a ZIP
* Install the [IBM Cloud CLI](https://console.bluemix.net/docs/cli/reference/bluemix_cli/download_cli.html)
* Provision a [Message Hub Service Instance](https://console.ng.bluemix.net/catalog/services/message-hub/) in [IBM CloudÂ®](https://console.ng.bluemix.net/)
* Install [Gradle](https://gradle.org/)
* Install Java 7+

## Standard or Enterprise Plan?

**It's important to know which Message Hub plan you're using as the sample deployment steps are subtly different on each plan respectively.**

By this point, you should have a Message Hub instance provisioned. If you haven't done this step yet, please refer to the main [readme](../README.md).

If you are not sure what type of Message Hub instance you have then you can find this information out by visiting IBM Cloud's web console [dashboard](https://console.bluemix.net/dashboard).

*Please make sure you are in the appropriate Region, Account, Organization and Space where you provisioned your Message Hub instance!*

* Message Hub Standard plan services are "Cloud Foundry Services" with the plan column showing "Standard".
* Message Hub Enterprise plan services are "Services" with the plan column showing "Enterprise".


## Deploy the Application

As the Standard and Enterprise Plan deployment steps are subtly different, we split the deployment steps into separate sections. Please navigate to the appropriate page(s):

### [Standard Plan Deployment Guide](CF_Standard_Plan.md)

### [Enterprise Plan Deployment Guide](CF_Enterprise_Plan.md)
