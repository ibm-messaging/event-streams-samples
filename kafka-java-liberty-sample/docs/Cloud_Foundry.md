## Prerequisites
To build and run the sample, you must have the done the following:

* Obtain this repository's contents, either use `git` or just download the samples as a ZIP
* Install the [IBM Cloud CLI](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cli?topic=cloud-cli-install-ibmcloud-cli)

## Standard/Enterprise Plan?

**It's important to know which Event Streams for IBM Cloud plan you're using as the sample deployment steps are subtly different on each plan respectively.**

By this point, you should have an Event Streams for IBM Cloud instance provisioned. If you haven't done this step yet, please refer to the main [readme](../README.md).

If you are not sure what type of Event Streams for IBM Cloud instance you have then you can find this information out by visiting IBM Cloud's web console [dashboard](https://cloud.ibm.com/resources).

*Please make sure you are in the appropriate Region, Account, Organization and Space where you provisioned your Event Streams instance!*

* Event Streams for IBM Cloud Standard plan services are "Services" with the plan column showing "Standard".
* Event Streams for IBM Cloud Enterprise plan services are "Services" with the plan column showing "Enterprise".
