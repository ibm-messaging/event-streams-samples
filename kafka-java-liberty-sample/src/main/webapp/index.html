            IBM Cloud® Message Hub is a scalable, distributed, high throughput messaging service built on the top of Apache Kafka.
            It underpins the integration of your on-premise and off-premise cloud services and technologies.
            You can wire micro-services together using open protocols, connect stream data to analytics to realise powerful insight and feed event data to multiple applications to react in real time.
        </br></br>
            This repository holds a sample cloud web application that was built using Liberty for Java™.
            The app will interact with a bound message hub service to produce and consume messages.
