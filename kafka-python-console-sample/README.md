# IBM Event Streams for IBM Cloud Kafka Python console sample application
This Python console application demonstrates how to connect to [IBM Event Streams for IBM Cloud](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/services/EventStreams?topic=eventstreams-getting_started), send and receive messages using the [confluent-kafka-python](https://github.com/confluentinc/confluent-kafka-python) library. It also shows how to create and list topics using the Event Streams for IBM Cloud Admin REST API.

__Important Note__: This sample creates a topic with one partition on your behalf. On the Standard plan, this will incur a fee if the topic does not already exist.

## Running the application

The application can be run in the following environments:

* [IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service](./docs/Kubernetes_Service.md) 
* [IBM Cloud Foundry](./docs/Cloud_Foundry.md)
* [Docker Local](./docs/Docker_Local.md)
