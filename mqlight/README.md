## Using the MQ Light API in Message Hub
The MQ Light API provides a simple AMQP-based messaging interface for Javaâ„¢, Node.js, Python, and Ruby. The API is provided for backward compatibility with the earlier MQ Light service. The MQ Light API is available as part of the Standard plan only. For more information, please refer to our [documentation](https://console.bluemix.net/docs/services/MessageHub/messagehub075.html#mql_using).
